	    		Flying is in our blood
	    	</h2>
	    	<p>When the whole neighborhood (and even some strangers) started calling Jamie asking to fly with him and be shown the world from above, Soheil proposed that they go into business together so they could both do what they loved. SkyAir was born. (Airborn.)

	    	<h2>
	    		Serving the local community
	    	</h2>
	    	<p>Located on Burnaby Mountain, SkyAir has been showing tourists and residents of the lower mainland the beauty of the sky and mountains since 2001. Every year we give back by taking students from underpriviledged highschools up in our chopper for their graduation events.

	 				Some say Jamie was bitten by a radioactive pigeon at 5, giving him uncanny aeronautical ability and a taste for bread crumbs. He's been a pilot for 15 years and attends the occasional local comicon.

	 				After 6 years managing YVR airport, I decided government work wasn't for me. When Jamie proposed the idea for us to go into business together, I left it all behind. Sky Air is my labor of love.
