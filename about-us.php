It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

	 			<p>
	 				Rumor has it that Jamie was bitten by a radioactive pigeon when he was 5 years old, giving him an uncanny aeronautical ability and an insatiable desire for bread crumbs. He's been a licensed pilot for 15 years and attends the occasional local comic convention.

	 			<p>
	 				After 6 years managing YVR airport, I decided government work wasn't for me. When Jamie proposed the idea for us to go into business together, I left it all behind. Sky Air is my labor of love.
